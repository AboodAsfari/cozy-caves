# Contributing Guidelines  

In order to ensure the quality of committed code, no pull request should be merged into the main branch unless at least one peer for the module deems the work to be fit for the main branch. If the work is not module-specific but is instead general project management work, then the rule applies on a case-by-case basis, as not all documentation or added files need to be reviewed unless they directly affect either the project direction or functionality.

Avoid committing code into files that belong to other modules, unless the people working on the module are aware. This is just so that there isn't code written that becomes overriden later due to other work being performed on the files. 

For ease of access, a table of module workers and peers has been written here. For additional information on modules, check the initial plan document.
